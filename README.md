# NEXCOM 

NEX = A connection or series of connections linking two or more things.

COM = Communication

NEXCOM is a centralized communications system that uses an API to forward messages and voice and video calls from all communication platforms and accounts, including Facebook Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Discord, Teams, Telegram, and more. These messages and calls are then forwarded to the user's native application, such as FaceTime, Messages, Phone, and Mail, on their mobile device. Users can choose to either identify the messages from their originating platform or keep them hidden. This means that the user sees a message that appears no different from a regular text message, email, or call and can reply or answer without switching to each individual platform's application.

By eliminating the need for users to install multiple messaging platforms on their device, NEXCOM reduces the device's attack surface and improves its security posture. It is worth noting that certain details have been redacted to protect sources, methods, and intellectual property.
